repo-sync
=========

Will be an utility to easily mirror multiple git repositories to a another
location. Useful for example if you would like to have a copy of your code
on github or similar services, while actually working with your own server.


Features
--------

* Support for git
* (Planned) Support for bzr/hg.
* (Planned) Ability to sync using cron, or via a post-commit hook. Function
  to auto-install the hooks in all synced repositories.
* (Planned) Work seemlessly with gitosis, bazitis, mercurial-server or
  similar tools.


Usage
-----

Define the repositories you want to mirror in a config file. The file can
be placed in on of the following locations:

    .reposync.conf
    ~/.reposync.conf
    /etc/reposync.conf

Each line contains one sync job; Currently, two columns are expected,
separated by whitespace: the repository path, followed by the target
push url:

    /home/git/repos/reposync.git   git@github.com:miracle2k/reposync.git

Lines prefixed with ``#`` are considered comments and are ignored, as
are empty lines.

repo-sync
=========

Will be an utility to easily mirror multiple git repositories to a another
location. Useful for example if you would like to have a copy of your code
on github or similar services, while actually working with your own server.


Planned Features
----------------

* Initial support for git only, bzr/hg planned.
* Ability to sync using cron, or via a post-commit hook. Function to
  auto-install the hooks in all synced repositories.
* Work seemlessly with gitosis, bazitis, mercurial-server or similar tools.
